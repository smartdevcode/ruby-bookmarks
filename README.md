# Ruby and Rails Bookmarks

The goal of the project is to aggregate essential Ruby resources into a single well-structured and commented list, and keep it up to date. It is inspired by [frontend-dev-bookmarks](https://github.com/dypsilon/frontend-dev-bookmarks) — a community-driven bookmarks collection for frontend developers.
