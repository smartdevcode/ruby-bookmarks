# Ruby Bookmarks

The goal of the project is to aggregate essential Ruby and Ruby on Rails resources into a single well-structured, and keep it up to date. It was inspired by [frontend-dev-bookmarks](https://github.com/dypsilon/frontend-dev-bookmarks) — a community-driven bookmarks collection for frontend developers.
